The vim textobject plugin to treat function-call-like regions.

Default mappings are assigned to 'if' and 'af'.

* 'if' and 'af', both of them select a region like 'func(argument)'.
* 'if' and 'af' behave differently when a function takes another function as its argument.
* 'if' selects the most inner function under the cursor.
* 'af' selects the first function including the cursor position by its parenthesis. However if any candidate would be found, it falls back to 'if'.

For example the cursor is on '2' of "func1(func2(argument))"
* 'if' selects "func2(argument)".
* 'af' selects "func1(func2(argument))".

This textobject could select following similar patterns.
* func(argument)
* array[index]
